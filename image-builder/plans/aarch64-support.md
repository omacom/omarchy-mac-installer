# Plan: aarch64 (Generic UEFI ARM64) build for omarchy-iso

## Context

omarchy-iso currently produces a single x86_64 Arch Linux live ISO. The build is x86-baked from top to bottom — profile arch, package list filename, microcode, kernel choice (`linux-t2`), bootloader configs (BIOS syslinux + UEFI GRUB), squashfs BCJ filter, Node.js download URL, QEMU smoke-test, release filename, and CI runner.

Target: a parallel **generic UEFI aarch64** ISO — boots on Ampere servers, AWS Graviton VMs, Snapdragon X laptops, ARM dev kits. Anything that exposes vanilla UEFI + ACPI. Apple Silicon (Asahi) and SBCs (U-Boot/rpi-firmware) are out of scope.

**Assumption:** cross-repo dependencies are someone else's problem to land first. This plan only covers omarchy-iso. The hard prerequisites are listed up front so it's clear what blocks the first green build.

---

## Hard prerequisites (NOT in this plan, but block any green build)

These exist outside omarchy-iso. Flagged for visibility — without them, nothing here boots:

1. **aarch64 base packages must exist somewhere we can pacman from.** Vanilla Arch (`geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com`) is x86_64-only — there is no `core/os/aarch64`. The realistic source is **Arch Linux ARM** (`mirror.archlinuxarm.org`) for `core`/`extra`/`alarm`/`aur`. Decision required: target Arch Linux ARM as the aarch64 base distribution.
2. **`pkgs.omarchy.org/{stable,edge}/aarch64/`** must serve a real repo. Probed today, both return 404. omarchy-pkgs already has multi-arch build support per its README, so this is a publish step, not a port.
3. **Omarchy ISO architecture guard** must allow supported architectures or scope any x86_64-only checks behind an explicit guard.
4. **archinstall + Limine** must work end-to-end on aarch64. archinstall supports it; Limine supports aarch64 UEFI. Worth a manual verification before committing to this bootloader path on ARM.

---

## Approach

Add an `--arch aarch64` flag to `bin/omarchy-iso-make`. Branch on it everywhere x86_64 is currently assumed. Don't fork the profile directory — overlay arch-specific files at build time so the two architectures share one source of truth.

Output artifact naming already uses no arch suffix until release-time renaming, so two parallel builds coexist cleanly.

---

## Concrete changes

### 1. Build entrypoint — `bin/omarchy-iso-make`

- Add `--arch x86_64|aarch64` flag (default `x86_64` for backward compat).
- Pass `OMARCHY_ARCH` env var into the container.
- Switch the docker image / platform per arch:
  - x86_64: `archlinux/archlinux:latest` (unchanged)
  - aarch64: `archlinuxarm/archlinuxarm:latest` (or `menci/archlinuxarm` — pick whichever publishes a recent multi-arch image), with `--platform linux/arm64`. Native arm64 host preferred; QEMU emulation works but is slow.
- Don't change pacman cache mount on the host: pacman keeps per-arch subdirs, so the cache is safe to share.

### 2. Profile — `configs/profiledef.sh`

Change `arch` and the squashfs BCJ filter at runtime. Either:
- Keep one `profiledef.sh` and have `builder/build-iso.sh` `sed` the arch line + BCJ filter (`x86` → `arm`) before `mkarchiso` runs, **or**
- Source `OMARCHY_ARCH` directly inside `profiledef.sh` (mkarchiso sources this file with bash, so env access is fine).

`bootmodes` also needs to drop `bios.syslinux` for aarch64 (BIOS boot is x86-only) — `bootmodes=('uefi.grub')` on ARM.

### 3. Build script — `builder/build-iso.sh`

- **Line 56–57**: Node.js URL grep. Branch on `OMARCHY_ARCH`:
  - `x86_64` → `linux-x64.tar.gz`
  - `aarch64` → `linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- **Line 73**: package additions. Drop `linux-t2` for aarch64 (T2-only x86 kernel) — use plain `linux`. Write to `packages.${OMARCHY_ARCH}` instead of hardcoded `packages.x86_64`.
- **Line 77**: read same `packages.${OMARCHY_ARCH}` for offline mirror enumeration.
- **archiso releng overlay** (`cp -r /archiso/configs/releng/*`): the upstream `releng` profile ships only `packages.x86_64`. For aarch64, copy `packages.x86_64` to `packages.aarch64` and prune obviously x86-only entries (`memtest86+`, `intel-ucode`, `amd-ucode`, `edk2-shell` x64 binary, `syslinux`). Land this as a small fixup step in `build-iso.sh` rather than a full fork of `releng`.

### 4. archinstall package list — `builder/archinstall.packages`

Drop microcode for aarch64 — `intel-ucode` and `amd-ucode` don't exist for ARM. Either:
- Two lists (`archinstall.packages.x86_64`, `archinstall.packages.aarch64`), or
- One list with sentinel comments and a filter step in `build-iso.sh:80` that drops microcode lines when `OMARCHY_ARCH=aarch64`.

The second is less duplication for one-line drift.

### 5. Bootloader configs

aarch64 has no BIOS — only UEFI. Drop the syslinux path entirely on ARM.

- **Skip on aarch64**: `configs/syslinux/*` (BIOS syslinux), `configs/grub/*` references to `shellx64.efi`/`shellia32.efi` (lines 81–85 of `grub.cfg`).
- **`configs/efiboot/loader/loader.conf`**: change `default 01-archiso-x86_64-linux.conf` to a per-arch entry. Either two loader.conf files (selected by build-iso.sh) or rename the entry generically (`01-archiso-linux.conf`) and keep one file.
- **`configs/efiboot/loader/entries/01-archiso-x86_64-linux.conf`**: produce an aarch64 sibling (`01-archiso-aarch64-linux.conf`) at build time — same template, drop microcode initrd lines, swap title. The kernel/initrd paths use `%ARCH%` already in `grub.cfg` but are hardcoded `x86_64` in this file (line 3–4).
- **`configs/grub/grub.cfg` and `loopback.cfg`**: remove or guard the x86_64 conditionals. The `%ARCH%` placeholder gets substituted by mkarchiso from `profiledef.sh:arch`, so the kernel/initrd paths flip automatically. Manually-written `grub_cpu == 'x86_64'` blocks (lines 34–39, 68, 81–85) should drop on aarch64 builds — easiest done with a build-time sed for the aarch64 path, or by extracting them into a separate `grub-x86_64.cfg.fragment` only included on x86 builds.

The cleanest cut: keep one `grub.cfg` shared, strip the x86 shell/memtest fragments at build time when `OMARCHY_ARCH=aarch64`. Don't fork the file.

### 6. mkinitcpio preset — `configs/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-t2.preset`

Names `vmlinuz-linux-t2` and `initramfs-linux-t2.img`. The filename is the pkgbase and the alpm hook keys off it, so aarch64 does not rename this file — it simply does not ship it, and releng's own `linux.preset` covers the stock kernel. Drop `linux-t2` from `arch_packages` on aarch64 and the boot entries point at `vmlinuz-linux` / `initramfs-linux.img`.

### 7. Configurator — `configs/airootfs/root/configurator`

Lines 320–325:
```bash
if lspci -nn 2>/dev/null | grep -q "106b:180[12]"; then
  kernel_choice="linux-t2"
else
  kernel_choice="linux"
fi
```
T2 detection is harmless on aarch64 (`lspci` returns no match), so `kernel_choice` falls through to `linux`. **No change strictly required**, but clearer to wrap the lspci probe in `[[ $(uname -m) == "x86_64" ]]` so the intent reads correctly. Cheap.

The archinstall JSON's `mirror_config.custom_servers` (lines 422–424) points at `mirror.omarchy.org`, `mirror.rackspace.com/archlinux`, `geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com` — none of these serve aarch64. For aarch64 the list must be `mirror.archlinuxarm.org` and friends. Branch the JSON template on `OMARCHY_ARCH` (or `uname -m` at runtime, since this file runs on the live ISO).

### 8. pacman configs — `configs/pacman-online-{stable,rc,edge,offline}.conf`

The `$arch` placeholder is pacman-resolved (matches `Architecture = auto`), so `https://stable-mirror.omarchy.org/$repo/os/$arch` adapts automatically — **as long as the mirror serves aarch64**. The omarchy mirror is the bottleneck (prerequisite #2). The `arch-mact2` repo is x86-only by definition; gate it behind arch on aarch64 builds (drop the section).

### 9. Smoke-test scripts — `bin/omarchy-iso-boot`, `bin/omarchy-vm`

Detect arch from the ISO filename (or accept a flag) and switch:
- x86_64: `qemu-system-x86_64`, `/usr/share/edk2/x64/OVMF_CODE.4m.fd` + `OVMF_VARS.4m.fd` (unchanged).
- aarch64: `qemu-system-aarch64`, `-machine virt -cpu max`, `/usr/share/edk2/aarch64/QEMU_CODE.fd` + `QEMU_VARS.fd` (Arch package: `edk2-armvirt`).

Both scripts hardcode the OVMF path; small, mechanical fix.

### 10. Release script — `bin/omarchy-iso-release:52`

```bash
latest_iso=$(\ls -t "$BUILD_RELEASE_PATH"/*${OMARCHY_ARCH}-"$ISO_REF".iso | head -n1)
```
Hardcoded `x86_64` glob. Take an arch arg, or do `*${OMARCHY_ARCH}-${ISO_REF}.iso`. The ISO filename already contains arch (set by archiso from `profiledef.sh`), so this just needs the glob parameterized.

### 11. CI — `.github/workflows/nightly-build.yml`

Add a matrix:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    arch: [x86_64, aarch64]
    include:
      - arch: x86_64
        runner: ubuntu-latest
      - arch: aarch64
        runner: ubuntu-24.04-arm   # GitHub-hosted ARM runner, GA
```
Pass `--arch ${{ matrix.arch }}` to the build. Upload artifacts named per-arch.

If GitHub-hosted ARM runners aren't available on this org's plan, fall back to QEMU emulation on `ubuntu-latest` (slow, ~3-4× build time) or self-hosted.

---

## Files to modify (summary)

Code:
- `bin/omarchy-iso-make` — add `--arch` flag, branch docker image/platform
- `bin/omarchy-iso-boot` — branch QEMU binary + OVMF path
- `bin/omarchy-vm` — same as iso-boot
- `bin/omarchy-iso-release` — parameterize ISO glob
- `builder/build-iso.sh` — main branching: Node.js URL, package list filename, releng overlay fixups, kernel package
- `builder/archinstall.packages` — filter microcode on aarch64 (sentinel comments + filter step)
- `configs/profiledef.sh` — env-driven `arch` + BCJ filter + bootmodes
- `configs/efiboot/loader/loader.conf` — per-arch default entry
- `configs/efiboot/loader/entries/01-archiso-x86_64-linux.conf` — generate aarch64 sibling at build time
- `configs/grub/grub.cfg`, `loopback.cfg` — strip x86-only fragments on aarch64
- `configs/airootfs/etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-t2.preset` — omit on aarch64 (drop linux-t2 there; releng's linux.preset covers the stock kernel)
- `configs/airootfs/root/configurator` — branch archinstall JSON mirror list on `uname -m`; optionally guard lspci T2 probe
- `.github/workflows/nightly-build.yml` — matrix x86_64/aarch64

No new files unless we go the dual-list route on archinstall.packages or efiboot loader entries; preferred path is build-time templating to keep one source of truth.

## Verification

**Local (host is x86_64):**
1. `bin/omarchy-iso-make --arch x86_64` — must produce a byte-similar ISO to today's nightly (smoke test for regressions in the refactor).
2. `bin/omarchy-iso-make --arch aarch64` — succeeds (slow under QEMU binfmt; expect 30-60 min).
3. `bin/omarchy-iso-boot release/omarchy-*-aarch64-*.iso` — boots to the configurator under `qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt`. Walk through the picker, confirm archinstall lays down a working system, reboot into the installed system.
4. Live-iso shell: `pacman -Sy && pacman -Si linux` returns an aarch64 package from `mirror.archlinuxarm.org`.

**On real hardware (post green QEMU run):**
- AWS Graviton VM (`c7g.medium`, dd ISO to a volume, attach as boot) — fastest cloud check, no hardware needed.
- One physical ARM64 UEFI box if available (Ampere dev kit, Snapdragon X laptop, etc.) — the long pole.

**CI:**
- Both matrix legs go green on a manual `workflow_dispatch` before merging.
- Nightly produces both ISOs as artifacts.

---

## Open risks (call out before implementation)

1. **mkarchiso on aarch64 is less-trodden ground.** It accepts `arch="aarch64"`, but the upstream Arch project doesn't dogfood it. Expect to file/patch around small bugs in archiso's helper scripts. Keep the archiso submodule pin tight so a regression doesn't surprise nightly.
2. **Limine + LUKS + Btrfs + Snapper on aarch64** — every one of these works individually on ARM, but the combination is what omarchy ships. Worth one manual end-to-end pass before declaring done.
3. **Apple T2 / linux-t2 / `arch-mact2` repo** are silently dropped on aarch64; users mistakenly trying to install the aarch64 ISO on a T2 Mac will get an obviously-wrong result. The configurator could refuse to install when arch mismatch is detected, but that's outside this plan.

## ARM64 VM encrypted-boot UX

The M4/HVF acceptance run exposed generic QEMU `virt` behavior, not physical
Apple-hardware behavior. With no explicit installed `console=`, QEMU firmware
advertises the PL011 UART as stdout; Linux consequently selects `ttyAMA0` as
`/dev/console`, and systemd's initramfs password agent can become the only
visible LUKS prompt even after `virtio-gpu` initializes.

For encrypted ARM64 installs, the generated UKI command line must select
`console=tty0` and include `plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles`. The initramfs
continues to use `systemd`, `kms`, `plymouth`, and `sd-encrypt`. The headless
acceptance harness retains serial logging but enters the passphrase through
the same emulated graphical keyboard used by an interactive QEMU window; no
headless-only console parameter is persisted into the installed target.

Acceptance requires both a fresh interactive graphical encrypted install and
the automated encrypted headless path. Physical Apple-hardware acceptance is
not implied or required by this VM-specific gate.

### Acceptance evidence (2026-08-25 UTC)

- Source commit: `c0f0afd2115b1d5b1220e16aeb95ee67132da7b6`.
- Unpublished acceptance ISO:
  `omarchy-2026.08.25-aarch64-quattro-c0f0afd.iso`, SHA-256
  `a12358125785691069a9a869283c5d8bdd98b17eb7edc83c6a120a48c13c2550`.
- Package input remained the exact published candidate
  `asahi-packages-candidate-a9bf4e5da273af2d4b432b3e0b123f74f3c5b933`
  with descriptor SHA-256
  `d1638d35b816c4bbdedd2e3a3e60f08643df7952dc1c584e59ceeebffa132000`.
  No package was rebuilt or substituted.
- Builder: native aarch64 Lima VM on an M4 Pro, rootful Docker, 10 vCPUs and
  24 GiB RAM. A rootless Docker attempt was rejected by Archiso's privileged
  chroot mount and produced no ISO; the rootful rerun completed successfully.
- Installed `/etc/kernel/cmdline` and `/proc/cmdline` both contained
  `splash console=tty0 plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles`, with no
  `console=ttyAMA0`. The installed initramfs retained the systemd hook set and
  the generated drop-in inserted `plymouth` and `sd-encrypt`; Plymouth used
  `Theme=omarchy`.
- Graphical reboot: QEMU 11.1.0 with HVF, 10 vCPUs, 12 GiB RAM, UEFI,
  `virtio-gpu-pci`, and the Cocoa display showed the Omarchy Plymouth lock and
  password field. The passphrase entered through the emulated USB keyboard
  unlocked the root disk and the same graphical window reached the Omarchy
  desktop. Evidence is under
  `armux-c0f0afd/graphical-reboot/frames/frame-20.png` and
  `armux-c0f0afd/graphical-reboot/after-unlock-10s.png` on the M4 acceptance
  host.
- Serial remained log-only during the automated run. The installed kernel
  reported `ttyAMA0 tty0` as active consoles and systemd retained its generated
  serial getty fallback, but the unlock prompt was graphical and was not
  diverted to serial.
- Headless encrypted acceptance used the same fresh installed base and typed
  the LUKS passphrase through QMP's graphical keyboard path. The complete PR
  #51 acceptance suite passed in run `20260826-080106`; run
  `20260826-075821` had one transient weather-data timeout and passed on the
  unchanged rerun.

This evidence covers generic ARM64 QEMU/HVF VM behavior only. It is not
physical Apple-hardware acceptance, and the ISO remains unpublished.

### 4.0.1 acceptance evidence (2026-08-26 UTC)

- The accepted Phase 3 baseline is
  `1823960c6772179d6878d9bc3938f7f94f0c0fa1` from the remote
  `phase-3-arch-selector` branch. The previous `85d0bb4` checkpoint is
  divergent from that commit and was not used.
- ISO pin and build source commit:
  `563439fdf8b1c04d371b24bcd362b468c4dc1645`.
- Runtime source commit: `15432eb5419bb904d51ca6f4fd43b407b9bac935`.
  The source release tag `v4.0.1-mac.1` points to the later documentation-only
  commit `a7da35e08462e09529fab28e90dbc72eae659827`; no runtime file differs.
- Package candidate:
  `asahi-packages-candidate-009293b616cf87677484b8670e93edfa815a7f8e`,
  descriptor SHA-256
  `97f0a6ea7bd57890db0b46e1a663c687b16310a04daac0533af14e50de1e0349`.
  Runtime manifest SHA-256:
  `0e3b49f0133e3833c8b2b7aad89728028a8db8581743155875e91d77bac99451`.
  Repository manifest SHA-256: the candidate `SHA256SUMS` asset is
  `90808b662430856c58fa809cdacbc0d901b16d9e12dbe30c22ea79ca9e51dc10`.
- The exact accepted assets were promoted without rebuilding as
  `asahi-packages-stable-009293b616cf87677484b8670e93edfa815a7f8e`.
  Immutable release readback and byte-for-byte inventory comparison passed.
- Unpublished ISO: `omarchy-2026.08.26-aarch64-quattro.iso`, SHA-256
  `aac9b1297240c61d8c96a3f1c60026911992f6941d2269e8597798f21d4fa96d`.
  It was built once inside the native aarch64 `phase3-arm-build` Lima VM on
  the M4 Pro using rootful Docker, 10 vCPUs, and 24 GiB RAM. Host-side Bash,
  GNU grep, mount-namespace, and rootless-Docker preflight failures produced
  no ISO before the isolated rootful build completed.
- Fresh encrypted install, reboot, and the full encrypted headless suite
  passed against that exact ISO. The accepted run is
  `/Users/maralc/omarchy-v4.0.1-arm64-acceptance-20260826/omarchy-iso/test-runs/omarchy-2026.08.26-aarch64-quattro-encrypted/runs/20260826-104912`
  on the M4. The suite passed all acceptance files in 68 seconds and retained
  71 screenshots.
- A separate fresh installed base from the same ISO was booted with QEMU
  11.1.0, HVF, 10 vCPUs, 12 GiB RAM, UEFI, `virtio-gpu-pci`, and the Cocoa
  display. `frames/frame-12.png` shows the graphical Omarchy Plymouth LUKS
  field. After entry through the emulated USB keyboard,
  `after-unlock-10s.png` shows the Omarchy desktop. SDDM, `graphical.target`,
  Hyprland, and Quickshell were active; Node reported `v26.7.0` on aarch64;
  and no system or user units were failed. Evidence is under
  `/Users/maralc/omarchy-v4.0.1-arm64-acceptance-20260826/evidence/graphical-reboot`.
- The installed command line retained
  `splash console=tty0 plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles`; the initramfs drop-in
  retained `plymouth` plus `sd-encrypt`; and the Plymouth theme was `omarchy`.
- M4 host-protection fingerprints were unchanged. The active Omarchy system
  was not updated or rebooted.

This remains generic ARM64 QEMU/HVF VM acceptance. The replacement ISO is
accepted but unpublished, and no public ISO channel has been advanced pending
explicit publication authorization.
