"""TEST IMAGES ONLY: keep a candidate set's runtime through a pacman -Syu.

A test candidate set's runtime is built from one omarchy-mac commit and
versioned 4.0.0.alpha..., which sorts below the channel's omarchy (4.0.2 on
edge), so a pacman -Syu on the installed Mac would replace it with the
channel's. An image built from a test set (candidate_only, which is every set
the importer accepts) therefore ignores upgrades of the packages built from the
set's source commit, in a marked block of /etc/pacman.conf's [options]. A set
package taken from the channel (the boot package, the closure) keeps following
it. The runtime's own pacman templates carry no pin, and nothing else in the
image changes. Deleting the marked lines makes the Mac follow its channel.

  test_image_pin.py names IMPORT_JSON              prints the pinned packages
