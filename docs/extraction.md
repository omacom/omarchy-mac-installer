# Installer extraction

[omacom/omarchy-mac-installer](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy-mac-installer) contains the standalone development source extracted from [maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac at 4db862da7a0957758c504c5a3e041202019dbabf](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/tree/4db862da7a0957758c504c5a3e041202019dbabf/apps/omarchy-apple-installer). Publishing this source enables collaboration; it does not qualify an installation release.

## Provenance

The installer directory becomes the repository root. The source repository's MIT [LICENSE](../LICENSE), original icon, three installer shell tests, their shared support file, and the recorded journal fixture are also retained. The exact path list and tool revision are in [extraction-source.json](extraction-source.json).

The import retains 114 relevant commits, including their original authors, committers, dates and messages. Commit IDs change because the repository trees and ancestry change; original commit signatures cannot authenticate rewritten commits. [extraction-commit-map.txt](extraction-commit-map.txt) maps each retained original commit to its extracted commit. The original repository remains the authority for original signatures and omitted desktop history. PR numbers retained in imported commit subjects refer to the repository where each change originated. Installer-specific subjects such as `(#183)` refer to [Marcelo’s source repository](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/pull/183); inherited upstream subjects such as `(#6749)` in `988ca27` and `(#1458)` in `d31cf10` refer to [omacom/omarchy#6749](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/pull/6749) and [omacom/omarchy#1458](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/pull/1458). These imported references do not identify issues or pull requests in this standalone repository.

The extraction base is `0d6f8661a5ad7b263d6167f0afea7cae033419a0`. All 206 files and their Git modes at that revision were compared with the selected source paths and match exactly. Subsequent commits contain standalone path adjustments and documentation so reviewers can separate those changes from the import.

The installer work and its recorded Git attribution are preserved, including Marcelo Alcantara's contributions and upstream Omarchy contributors. The root copyright notice remains unchanged. Asahi engine sources are external dependencies identified by [Engine/source-lock.json](../Engine/source-lock.json); their own licenses and notices must accompany distributed artifacts.

## Later imports

The installer changes from 2.0.6 to 2.0.10 were replayed from [maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac `4db862da..92a9054f`](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/compare/4db862da7a0957758c504c5a3e041202019dbabf...92a9054f4565b37739ac3bd4f0fb4fcf8bd48625), limited to `apps/omarchy-apple-installer`: source PRs #195, #197, #198, #223, #225, #228, #232, #259, #262 and #263. Each was exported with `git format-patch --relative=apps/omarchy-apple-installer` and applied with `git am`, keeping the original author, date and message. Each message ends with `Imported from maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac@<sha>.` naming the source commit. Conflicts with `Packaging/identity.conf` were resolved in place, and the following commit derives the new identifiers from it and pins the runbook's source links.

The payload download retry from source PR #265 ([`16cb6869`](https://github.com/maralcbr/omarchy-mx-mac/commit/16cb6869ac30d9683ba7daaa2fa04361f169e3e0)) was replayed the same way. The one-page view's two retry hunks were applied by hand, since their context differs by this repository's encryption gate, and one test hunk was already present because this repository had wrapped that line for swift-format. It adds no identity literal. Its change to the source repository's install page (`docs/site/content/02-install.md`) has no counterpart here.

## Reproducing the import

Use the recorded source revision, not a moving branch. In a dedicated source clone, create a temporary `export/installer` branch at that revision, then export the listed paths with `git fast-export --show-original-ids --signed-tags=strip --tag-of-filtered-object=rewrite --reencode=no --use-done-feature export/installer -- PATHS...`. All paths must be available if using a sparse checkout.

In a separate empty Git repository initialized on `extract/installer`, feed that stream to the recorded `git-filter-repo` version:

```bash
python3 /path/to/git-filter-repo --stdin \
  --preserve-commit-hashes --preserve-commit-encoding \
  --path-rename apps/omarchy-apple-installer/: \
  --refname-callback 'return b"refs/heads/extract/installer"' < installer.fast-export
```

Compare the resulting tree with `extraction_base_tree` in the source record. This operation belongs only in a disposable extraction repository; never filter the shared desktop checkout.

## Boundaries of this change

This split preserves the current application identity, support gates, engine lock, release catalog URLs and public trust root. It does not make the inherited release configuration an Omacom release. Historical design notes and release helpers retain references to their original environment; those references are not setup instructions for the new repository.

The next integration should separately define the shared Linux image and package inputs, encrypted-install handoff, kernel selection, release ownership and validation evidence. In particular, the Linux payload must supply the shared runtime, settings and `omarchy-mac` package before hardware setup. The macOS app and the Linux image remain separate build products.

## Inherited prerequisites and open issues

- `Packaging/build-app.sh` requires the authenticated `installer-v0.9.0-omarchy.14.tar.gz` archive, SHA-256 `9e9277384b6c9e8b269cc79b1b24df7bfcdcbb898a596a677b74d1d18050aebe`, in `Engine/artifacts/`. This binary is not tracked. This is the inspection engine used before any downloads. The source lock records installation engine `.17`; those versions deliberately differ, as documented in `ValidationEngineArtifact.swift`. For the macOS assembly check, the exact `.14` archive was recovered from the [original published app](https://downloads.aicodelabs.com.au/installer/previews/20260918-e1b8abc05135/Omarchy-MX-Mac-Installer.zip) and verified against the pinned size and digest before use. No version or trust check was relaxed.
- `Engine/build-locked-engine.sh` still reads `downstream_overlay.metadata.path`, while the current source lock omits it and the verifier rejects that field. A complete native engine rebuild has not been validated. The authenticated-base Python overlay rebuild is a separate path; its tests are included.
- The native engine lock records exact tools and machine-specific paths. Keep those reproducibility constraints until deliberately reviewed; silently substituting another toolchain would not validate the recorded artifact.
- Release scripts retain the original publisher's endpoints, signing identity and historical defaults. Creating the new repository does not establish new signing or publishing authority. The old cutover and candidate helpers are retained for history and require review before operational use. Their repository paths now resolve inside this checkout; the cutover helper accepts an external image via `OMARCHY_OS_PAYLOAD`, otherwise retaining its sibling `omarchy-iso` convention.
- The exact model `apple,j614s` remains blocked. Availability of an M4 Pro for development does not qualify it as an installation target.

See [validation.md](validation.md) for the passing Linux and macOS checks and remaining qualification work.

## M3 inspection engine update

The later M3 trial updates the bundled inspection engine to `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.17.tar.gz`, 17,838,045 bytes, SHA-256 `ecb61645a9c75ba733425fb300b8b53b09f9dbc297a86acce1e0ee41f36e32e5`. The archive was reproduced exactly from locked engine source revision `8cb67b490fc8ffb4d9b338759403c18238a1b11a` and the authenticated `.14` base. The older inspection engine marks M3 devices as expert-only, so an M3-capable catalog alone cannot admit the host. The app locator and packager now pin the same verified `.17` archive. Catalog signatures, artifact verification, and the M4 `apple,j614s` prohibition remain unchanged.

The current imported planner contains a later disk-shortfall change whose hashes differ from the `.17` source lock. Reproduction uses the matching historical revision, not relaxed hash checks. Updating that planner in the runtime requires a separate engine revision. This inspection update does not add replacement support for legacy installations with only one Linux partition.

## Tight-disk inspection engine update

The `.18` inspection engine includes the tight-disk planner and staging-aware recommendation contract. Its filename is `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.18.tar.gz`, size is 17,839,116 bytes, and SHA-256 is `aba44d2050ecc84203a3a520ad53a0142e71f95d14245bd0313f1cb85bcbd565`. Two independent overlay repacks produced identical bytes from the authenticated `.14` base and locked Asahi `v0.9.2` source graph. Compared with the published `.17` archive, only `omarchy_asahi.py`, `omarchy_contract.py`, `omarchy_execution.py`, `omarchy_planner.py`, and `version.tag` changed. All other archive contents, member types, permissions, and link targets are unchanged.

Reproduce it with `python3 Engine/rebuild-python-overlay.py /path/to/locked-asahi-installer /path/to/installer-v0.9.0-omarchy.14.tar.gz Engine/artifacts/installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.18.tar.gz`, then run `Engine/verify-source-lock.py` against that checkout and `Engine/verify-archive-modes.py` against the result. The rebuild verifies the base digest, source graph, downstream inputs, and upstream delta before writing the archive. The generated archive is intentionally untracked.

At the `.18` revision, the bundled inspection pins and release-input templates named `.18`. Existing signed installation catalogs still select their own engine; publishing a catalog that admits `.18` is a separate release step. The frozen private-test `.17` catalogs and staging scripts retain their original identities.

## macOS reserve policy and coordinated 2.1.0 release

Engine `.20` enforces a hard free-space reserve of `38_000_000_000` bytes for macOS on every disk size. The container minimum is the larger of diskutil's preferred minimum and aligned current usage plus that reserve. The shared inventory feeds planning and live admission. Inventory probes upstream resizable containers plus GPT/APFS containers holding a versioned macOS. This keeps tight system containers visible for an exact shortfall, including any existing reserve deficit and remaining staging requirement, without adding unrelated stubs and data-only containers to the limits probes.

The departure from normal Asahi policy is that Omarchy can use the Linux partition floor without expert mode; macOS never gives up its 38 GB reserve. Swift calculates the allocation ceiling from the engine's hard minimum plus staging and drift allowances, without a second recommendation threshold that could shrink the range when space is freed. The review screen colors the macOS segment with the caution color below the recommended reserve, using the same threshold for its visible warning and accessibility value; the reserve marker and label are removed, and Omarchy update/snapshot cautions remain. Free-space estimates include staging reserves and are refreshed when planning; the engine remains authoritative at admission.

The pinned archive is `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.20.tar.gz`, 17,839,374 bytes, SHA-256 `7d7d87a934c128e501f8f6287d259195238ed1ae7953336b91738ff63514ea93`. Two repacks with macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 produced identical bytes from the authenticated `.14` base and locked v0.9.2 checkout. Use the command above with that interpreter and the `.20` output filename. Other Python/tarfile versions may encode equivalent tar headers differently, changing the archive digest; source and native member contents still need independent verification. Runtime Python remains the authenticated bundled 3.13 runtime.

After merging current `main` on 2026-10-03, two repacks with `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 again reproduced that exact pinned digest and size. A repack with Python 3.14.7 produced SHA-256 `e901371a4ba34d901a980b6f7586fc07d14234f9b50724ac4972e43ef35416af`, 17,839,417 bytes. All eight shipped downstream Python modules match the final repository sources byte for byte in both encodings, including the planner's disk-shortfall change. Reproduction must use the recorded interpreter before treating a different archive digest as stale source. The portable source-lock tests now check every downstream input and build recipe against its recorded digest, catching source changes without matching lock updates even when the upstream checkout is unavailable.

## Stub probe and divider margin fixes

Engine `.27` stops probing stub containers. A stub carries the version of the macOS it was made from, so a versioned OS alone admitted it to the limits probes, and one failed probe of a stub on a Mac with an existing Asahi or Omarchy install failed the whole inventory. The filter now admits only versioned OSes that are not stubs. The pinned archive is `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.27.tar.gz`, 17,839,422 bytes, SHA-256 `4f9241b0139ba6ccdcfdb3484831002e07e36ba50274279c641ca2020593a15a`. Two repacks with macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 produced identical bytes from the authenticated `.14` base and locked v0.9.2 checkout; compared with `.20`, only `omarchy_runtime.py` and `version.tag` changed. At #40, the bundled inspection pins and both release-input templates selected `.27`.

Swift now withholds the resize drift margin before adopting the recommended (doubled) Omarchy size as the minimum. Adopting it first left a band of free-space states where the minimum equalled the maximum: the divider could not move and no margin remained for the engine's admission check.

The catalog's installation engine is `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.28.tar.gz`, 17,843,348 bytes, SHA-256 `0cf1aa87760f90a545298b7cef737c9b497f2cad421d79ac59f557a81f2eb146`: the `.27` overlay with the Recovery step from #39 added. Two repacks with macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 produced identical bytes; compared with `.27`, only `omarchy_asahi.py`, `omarchy_runtime.py` and `version.tag` changed. The bundled inspection pins and packager select `.28` too, so the release scripts, which take the catalog engine from `Packaging/build-app.sh`, publish the engine the templates name.

## macOS 26 firmware and MacBook Neo engine

Engine `.29`, `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.29.tar.gz`, 17,851,067 bytes, SHA-256 `14323c787b94521451504d481f783b2710c259ae1448c8039db09ee5c6d8d337`, is `.28` plus macOS 26 firmware support and the MacBook Neo (`apple,j700`): reading the restore bundle macOS 26's bootcaches omit, collecting firmware and boot images from the running macOS when the recovery image is AEA-encrypted, the Neo's own Aurora Stage 1, its C1FE trackpad firmware, and its MT7932 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth inputs collected from macOS. Two repacks with macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 from a fresh v0.9.2 checkout produced identical bytes, after the same checkout reproduced `.28` exactly. Compared with `.28`, `omarchy_mt7932.py` is added and `main.py`, `omarchy_asahi.py` and `version.tag` changed. The bundled inspection pins, packager and both release templates selected `.29`. Public catalogs still do not admit `apple,j700`; only a developer build with a sealed developer catalog can.

Engine `.30`, `installer-v0.9.2-omarchy.30.tar.gz`, 17,852,406 bytes, SHA-256 `2d5a14c3dde7b9ebb7076cd65a6d5a478d7f20b6396fadb52b59532752d12bdc`, adds the MacBook Neo's Touch ID calibration to the firmware it collects: one standalone signed FSC2 IMG4 read from the raw iBoot System Container and installed as `apple/mesacal-j700.bin`. Two repacks with macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9.6 produced identical bytes; compared with `.29`, `omarchy_mesa.py` is added and `omarchy_asahi.py` and `version.tag` changed. The bundled inspection pins, packager and both release templates select `.30`.

Ship installer **2.1.0 or later** together with the new engine and a signed catalog whose `installer.minimumVersion` is at least **2.1.0**. Both release-input templates carry this gate, and the catalog generator refuses a lower minimum for `.18` or newer engines in this lineage. Older installers then show the update-required message before decoding recommendation fields. The bundled inspection pins now select `.30`; signed production catalogs and frozen private-test catalogs are not changed by this source update. Artifact publication, catalog signing and physical installation qualification remain separate release steps.
